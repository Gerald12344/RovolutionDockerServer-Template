# Rovolution Web Server

Vercel doesn't allow discord bots so this was created to handle stuff on a Discord bot but on a Docker server for my Docker swarm which is locally hosted.

See [Routes/ReadMe.md](https://github.com/RovolutionTeam/RovolutionLogisticsBot/tree/main/src/routes/ReadMe.md) for details on how to make routes
